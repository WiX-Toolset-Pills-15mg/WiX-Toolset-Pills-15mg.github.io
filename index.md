# WiX Toolset Pills 15mg

## What is a pill?

Each pill is a projects that addresses a small topic related to WiX Toolset.

Usually, each repository contains:

- Sample log files;
- other useful items.

## How to use?

### I) New to WiX Toolset?

Start by taking the repositories in the order suggested by "Learning Path" section.

1. **Article/Tutorial and Code**
   - In each repo, open the article (tutorial) and the Visual Studio project and read them side by side.
   - The article is written in markdown. You may use [Typora](https://typora.io/) or any other markdown editor you like.
2. **Write the code (from scratch)**
   - Next I suggest to write the entire installer project from scratch without using copy-paste. This may take somewhere between 15min and 30min.
   - You may look into the provided source code while writing your own project. Keep it opened in a second Visual Studio instance, but remember, <u>no copy-paste</u> is allowed !!!
3. **Kata**
   - Each pill can be exercised as kata. This is a Japanese term from martial arts. A kata is an exercise that is meant to be practiced again and again in order to create the reflexes needed in real combat.
   - Take the pill that you like and implement it once a day for a few days. For example, you may practice it for a week, then change the exercise and continue. This will help you get familiar with the aspects that are less intuitive.

### II) Already have experience with WiX Toolset?

1. **Playground**
   - Need a quick playground where you can check some WiX Toolset features? Choose the pill that is the closest to what you need, download the repo and start playing with it.
2. **Sample Logs**
   - Each repo contains sample log files that you may easily inspect without the need to compile and run the installer from that repo.
3. **Tutorials**
   - Need to learn about some WiX Toolset feature? It may already exist a pill with a tutorial for that feature. Download it and read the tutorial in parallel with the code.
